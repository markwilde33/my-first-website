  # My very first webpage
  
  Welcome!
  
  ### This project serves as a tutorial
  
  The purpose of this project is to familiarize the student with Cloud9 and Github. Specifically, how these two systems  interact with one another.
  
  Students learn how to create a simple webpage on Cloud9 and also how to upload it to Github. Furthermore, students learn how to make changes to the webpage using git commands; which are then reflected in Github.
  
  Github serves as a storage space for code and a place to share code with others.
